<p><b>Fairy</b></p>
<pre style="font-style:"italic><p>
      Over hill, over dale,<br>
      Thorough bush, thorough brier,<br>
      Over park, over pale,<br>
      Thorough flood, thorough fire,<br>
      I do wander everywhere,<br>
      Swifter than the moon's sphere;<br>
      And I serve the fairy queen,<br>
      To dew her orbs upon the green.<br>
      The cowslips tall her pensioners be:<br>
      In their gold coats spots you see;<br>
      Those be rubies, fairy favours,<br>
      In those freckles live their savours:<br>
      I must go seek some dewdrops here<br>
      And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.<br>
      Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:<br>
      Our queen and all our elves come here anon.<br>
      </p>
    </pre>
      <p><b>PUCK</b></p>
      <pre style="font-style:"italic><p>
        The king doth keep his revels here to-night:<br>
        Take heed the queen come not within his sight;<br>
        For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,<br>
        Because that she as her attendant hath<br>
        A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;<br>
        She never had so sweet a changeling;<br>
        And jealous Oberon would have the child<br>
        Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;<br>
        But she perforce withholds the loved boy,<br>
        Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:<br>
        And now they never meet in grove or green,<br>
        By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,<br>
        But, they do square, that all their elves for fear<br>
        Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there<br>
</p></pre>
